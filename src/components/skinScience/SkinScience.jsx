          <h1>Science-First Skin Care</h1> <br /> <br />
          <p>Our mission is to bring the highest levels of pharmaceutical science and innovation to the skincare industry while creating a new category of products designed to complement aesthetic procedures and maintain overall skin health. Our deep understanding of the science related to the functioning of the skin, and decades of experience creating unique and synergistic formulations containing peptides and active botanicals that support skin renewal, are the keys behind Alastin Skincare topical preparations.</p> <br />
          <p>When your skin's ability to recycle and repair collagen and elastin begins to slow, ALASTIN Skincare® offers an innovative collection of specially formulated and clinically proven products that include ingredients to help support the process. Meticulous clinical work and ingredient evaluation led to the development of TriHex Technology®, a combination of selected peptides and active botanicals that support the skin’s ability to clear out damage caused by aging and the environment and replenish with new healthy collagen and elastin.</p> <br />
          <p>Whether the goal is to create an essential daily skincare regimen or to enhance the appearance of skin following some of the most popular skin care procedures, ALASTIN Skincare® offers cruelty, paraben and gluten free solutions that promote fortified, healthy skin so patients can look refreshed and are free to feel fabulous, unfiltered and confident.</p> <br />
